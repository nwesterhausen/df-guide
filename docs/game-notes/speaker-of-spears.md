# Speaker of Spears

A Dwarven Fortress in The Common Mire on *The Perplexing Continent* governed by "The Spear of Glory" of the civilization "The Cradled Spear"

## Embark Decisions

Decided to embark with 10 dwarves, where 4 were speardwarves. Then had 2 herbalists, a farmer, a carpenter, and a fish-cleaner mechanic. Chose to embark in a location with fire-clay -- I really want to do ceramics! Location is a jungle of untamed wilds; I did not bring any animals with me and plan to capture/tame or trade for them. For supplies I only brought a small amount of extra food on top of the default suggestions.

## Arrival and First Months

I got started by assigning nobles, the Speardwarf squad, designating a few trees to be felled and designating a hole into the hill we started on. The last thing I want is for my anvil to be stolen by some stupid bird. I used the wood from the first couple trees to build a shed encompassing the wagon and the down stairs to the underground shelter. I then made a dormitory and hospital as well as a small dining room and single-chair office for the bookkeeper/manager. I also set up an armor stand to have my military squad train.

I dug another few layers until stone and then dug out a large room to use as temporary workshop space and then dug out a series of 1x3 bedrooms (1x4 if you include the door). Also by now I had built a still to produce drinks and was gathering vegetation and fruit from outside the fortress. Prepared meals can come later. 

At this point I figured I want to set up a dwarven water reactor, and see what that's about so I designated that (and built it, haven't powered anything yet). I also designated a grand dining hall and library, as well as a mayoral suite. I have planned out ramps for minecarts up to both the sand collection zone and clay collection zone, and that series of ramps and tunnels leads to the future workshop layer. Underneath that layer I plan to have magma for running magma kilns, furnaces, smelters and forges. I also dug out a section for farming and have planned a tunnel for getting water to flood it to make it arable. 

As autumn arrived (and with it the caravan for trade), my miners were very busy. I had scraped together some wood crafts and uncut gems to trade for food, more picks and junk that may be needed in an a strange mood. I also made more crafts while they were waiting and traded for a couple books to put in the library. Right now I have no industry set up, just a gathering zone (food supply) and a still. Just trying to be stable enough that I can dig out the fortress proper.
