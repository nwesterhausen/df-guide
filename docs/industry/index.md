# Industry

Most of the information contained on the linked pages is my own summary of what is available on [the wiki](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/) unless otherwise notated. I divided up content mostly based on the [wiki industry page](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Industry), however that page is mostly concerned with specifying industries that produce products to make money but I wanted to have a short guide to encompass each thing you may need in your fort.
