# Animal Husbandry
Animals in Dwarf Fortress can be grazing or non-grazing and can be egg-layers or non-egg-layers. You would want to raise animals in your fort for one or more of the following reasons:

- Trade (you can trade caged animals)
- Meat/Leather/Bone (raising animals and butchering grown members)
- Eggs (egg-laying animals produce eggs which can be eaten themselves or used in cooking)
- Milk (some animals can be milked, and milk can be used for cheese or in cooking)
