# Animal Husbandry
Animals in Dwarf Fortress useful for food or other products. You would want to raise animals in your fort for one or more of the following reasons:

- Trade (you can trade caged animals)
- Meat/Leather/Bone (raising animals and butchering grown members)
- Eggs (egg-laying animals produce eggs which can be eaten themselves or used in cooking)
- Milk (some animals can be milked, and milk can be used for cheese or in cooking)
- Wool (some animals can be sheared for wool which can be spun into yarn)
- War/Hunting (some animals can be trained for war or hunting and protect/aid your dwarves)
