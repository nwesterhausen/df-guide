# Plant Industry
There are two sources for plant-based food, either gathering from naturally growing plants or trees (by a farmer with the [herbalist](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Herbalist) skill) or from plants grown in crop plots (by a farm with the [grower](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Grower) skill).

## Designation Gathering
The easiest method to gather plants is using "gather plants" from the [designation menu](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Designations_menu). Designate an area with naturally grown shrubs and dwarves with the plant gathering labor (herbalist skill) will begin harvesting viable plants from that area. This will create a lot of work in a biome with dense ground vegetation, like a jungle. In the badlands or a desert, there will be very few ground plants to gather.

This method will not gather fruits or nuts that have fallen on the ground (according to the wiki).

## Zoned Gathering
A plant gathering zone can be created and it acts as a permanent gathering designation for the entire zone. This means as shrubs and plants grow in the zone, it will create a plant gathering job to be performed. 

The plant gathering zones are additionally effective because within the zone, dwarves will use stepladders to gather fruit and nuts from trees, and will also gather fallen fruit and nuts. If you are in an area with fruit or nut trees, using a gathering zone to harvest them will provide a good amount of plants for cooking and brewing.

## Farm Plots
A [farm plot](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Farming) is built from the build menu. They cannot be placed on rock floors, they require dirt, mud, sand, loam or clay as a floor to be built. Depending on how much variety you are planning to grow, having multiple smaller plots is usually better than having one or two huge plots.

Only small plants can be grown in farm plots (no trees), and what seeds you get from above-ground plants need to be grown in similar light conditions. The subterranean plants are usually all available as seeds at embark. They can be grown at underground dark farms without an issue. You can grow aboveground crops underground as long as there is an acceptable light level for the plants to grow.
