# Prepare Carefully

When embarking, when selecting your starting equipment you can choose a preset or to prepare carefully. If you choose to prepare carefully, you are able to assign some skills to your starting dwarves.

## start with farmers

starting with a good farmer gives a boost to your starting food production. starting with 2 is even more productful, because your farmers can super grow food. combine this with a cook and brewer and you can have a very powerful trading position for your first couple caravans (and good food production for your fort). 

the idea is

- proficient farmer, decent appraiser
- proficient farmer
- proficient cook
- proficient brewer
- good organizer, good record keeper, good conversationalist
- proficient carpenter
- proficient architect, proficient mechanic

need to embark with a few picks and and axe. can skip an anvil if you feel good about trading for one at the first caravan. bring lots of seeds to take advantage of the two good farmers. set up brewing and make sure yo forbid seeds and plants you are farming from cooking. appraiser is your broker and the other noble is manager bookeeper and expedition leader. he only needs 1 chair then. 

dig down a layer, plant subterranean farms. set up and link stockpiles and still and kitchen to get started with production. etc

carpenter needs to keep up woth barrels for alcohol production, then barrels can be used to store food if you want. he also should make beds and a chair and then a couple tables and chairs. give the dwarves beds so they dont sleep on the ground and table chairs so they dont have to eat off the ground.
