## Uniforms

Uniforms make it easy to dictate what your dwarves will wear and make it easy to assign same uniform but 
modify the weapon for each squad.

### Basic Uniform

The basic uniform I have taken to using is combination of leather "underarmor" and metal armor, allowing 
for some protection while the metal industry is ramping up. This works out well because leather is so cheap
from the caravans and created on-site easily enough once you have a steady supply of raw hide.

Set the uniform to *exact match* and *replace clothing*
