# Military

Checklist for setup of military.

## Uniforms

Uniforms make it easy to dictate what your dwarves will wear and make it easy to assign same uniform but 
modify the weapon for each squad.

### Basic Uniform

The basic uniform I have taken to using is combination of leather "underarmor" and metal armor, allowing 
for some protection while the metal industry is ramping up. This works out well because leather is so cheap
from the caravans and created on-site easily enough once you have a steady supply of raw hide.

- metal	gauntlets
- metal	helm
- metal	leggings
- leather	trousers
- leather	leather armor
- metal	mail shirt
- leather	dress
- leather	hood

- leather	robe
- leather	cloak

`*` After you are producing metal armor you may want to replace leather shoes with metal high boots

Set the uniform to *exact match* and *replace clothing*

## Scheduling
Schedules can do a lot but are a bit fiddly to set up.

### A nobles squad
You don't want your nobles dying unintentionally, but having them in a squad will let you designate a nobility barracks for training, which can be nearby the noble bedrooms/offices.

### Everyone in the military
Can be good if you need all your dwarves to be able to defend themselves. In this set up, make sure you squad the miners and wood cutters in special pick and battle axe squads.

Ideally, have 12 squads (plus nobles squad), and this way you can provide some months of intense training and then some break time. Do this by taking the schedule below and shifting it 1 month for each squad so that you maximize patrols. You can do a patrol through each cavern layer, or around the surface outside your fort, or through your fort itself.

Assignment order:

| # Patrols | Orders for each month |
| -- | -- |
| 0 | Full Training x3, Inactive x9|
| 1 | Full Training x3, Patrol, Inactive x8 |
| 2 | (Full Training x2, Patrol, Inactive x3) x2 |
| 3 | (Full Training, Patrol, Inactive) x3, Inactive x3 |
| 4 | (Full Training, Patrol, Inactive) x4 |

The nobles can be inactive all the time, they will use their assigned location for individual drills. Optionally schedule a month or two a year for training.

### Dedicated military
Having a dedicated military lets your crafters craft. However, dwarves in the military still have needs. You should have a few workshops in your military sector restricted in the workshop Profile for low skilled workers, with linked stockpiles. In their downtime, they can use skills and be satisfied.
