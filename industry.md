# Cooking

## Wiki Info, Summarized

Cooking meals instead of just eating prepared meat and raw eggs is beneficial:

- prepared meals combine multiple stacks of food into a single, large stack (best value in lavish meals)
- turn excess booze into food
- once your cook begins to make masterwork meals, you have a very valuable trade good

You should disable cooking of certain items to make sure you don't run out of alcohol, tallow, or seeds. To encourage variety 
in food, the wiki [suggests](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Kitchen#What_to_cook) that you use a handful of different
stockpiles set to "give" to your kitchen and forbid them to use barrels. This is because cooks are typically lazy and will keep
grabbing solid incredients from a single barrel until they reach the number of ingredients needed for the meal they are preparing
([wiki](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Cook#Variety)). 

Dwaves eat [approximately 2 meals per season](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Food#Mechanics_of_eating_and_hunger). 
The amount of food that results from cooking is simple addition of the stacks of ingredients (nothing extra is created). However,
you are able to use drinks as an ingredient, as well as other "non-edible" food sources: flour, sugar, syrup, milk, seeds, honey, 
and tallow. (However, take note that you will want to forbid cooking of honey if you are making mead, seeds if you need them to
plant, tallow if you need it for soap production, and milk if you are making cheese).

# Farming

## Extraction

Using "Process plants (barrel)" at the Farmer's workshop: `1 Sweet pod --> 5 dwarven syrup`

Other extraction options do not product usable extracts, only trade goods.

## Milling

Performed at a millstone or quern, turns plants into [flour](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Flour#Flour_Varieties),
[dye](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Dye) or sugar (only from milling Sweet pods).

Would be useful to bump the value of produced meals or if you need to create a "solid" base item for meals.

## Pressing

Press seed pastes (or olives) into oil (used for soapmaking, or cooking) and a press cake (used in cooking). Also used to turn
honeycombs to honey (used for mead or cooking) and a wax cake (used for wax crafts). With _papermaking_ labor, you can turn plant
slurry into paper.
