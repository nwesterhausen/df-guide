# First Steps
Before unpausing, asses the map situation and assign labors to dwarves that may not have the skills for what you need done.

## Checklist Dump
- [ ] Assign all labors
- [ ] Appoint nobles, set bookkeeper to highest (they will keep up if set immediately)
- [ ] Confirm location for "starting" fort (i.e. shelter to sustain while you build fort proper)
- [ ] (Optional) choose a location by fruit trees for easy food
	- [ ] Zone an area for plant gathering
- [ ] Build butcher, tanner, fishery, carpenter, forge and smelter
- [ ] Zone and area for animal training, train dogs into war dogs
- [ ] Designate trees for logging (if you plan to gather fruit, pay attention to the type of tree)
- [ ] Check what other Units are on the map -- do you need to hurry?
- [ ] Mark the two pack animals from the wagon for butchering

- [ ] Smelter built: queue Coke, Bronze x3
- [ ] Bronze and coke bars: queue Bronze Pick x4, Bronze Axe x2
- [ ] Carpenter build: queue stepladders, wheelbarrows, chair x2, table x2, bed x7 and cage
