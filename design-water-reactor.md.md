## Dwarven Reactor
A simple machine that generates infinite power!

## Water Wheel Reactor
Design comes straight from the [DFwiki](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2014:Water_wheel#Dwarven_Water_Reactor), although I have modified it to produce more power and be a bigger footprint. In practice, building this should be on its own z-level and you would then use gears and rollers to "pipe" the power where you need it.
